            Hi, I'm Holger Mueller, a writer living in Minneapolis,MN.
          </p>

          <p class="bio-piece">
            I've had a pretty varried string of jobs. I've worked delivering
            phone books (ask your parents), as a ticket taker in a movie
            theater, assisting at a community care home for psychiatric
            outpatients from the VA hospital system, quite a few miserable years
            in retail, a clickbait writer, and as an English tutor and teacher,
            both in the States and in Korea.
          </p>
